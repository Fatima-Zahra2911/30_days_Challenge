🚀 Day 10: Introduction to React & Bootstrap Integration
Today marked an exciting step forward as I dove into the world of React.js, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. I covered everything from setting up a React environment to learning JSX, components, props, and integrating Bootstrap for styling.

📘 Topics Covered:
✅ Introduction to React
What is React and why it's used.

Understanding the concept of component-based architecture.

✅ Setting Up React Project
Installed Node.js and npm.

Created a new React app using:

bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app my-app
Explored the default folder structure of a React project.

✅ Folder Structure Overview
public/ – Static files like index.html.

src/ – Contains all React components and logic.

Entry point: index.js and main component: App.js.

✅ JSX (JavaScript XML)
Wrote HTML-like code within JavaScript.

Learned rules like enclosing in one parent tag and using className instead of class.

✅ Components
Built functional components using ES6 syntax.

Split UI into reusable parts.

✅ Props (Properties)
Passed data from parent to child components.

Used props for dynamic rendering.

✅ Bootstrap in React
Installed Bootstrap using:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install bootstrap
Imported Bootstrap in index.js:

js
Copy
Edit
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
Used Bootstrap classes in JSX for styling components.

🛠️ Practice Projects:
Created a sample component-based layout using JSX.

Built a simple Profile Card using props and Bootstrap classes.

🧠 Key Takeaways:
React allows building dynamic UIs using components.

JSX makes code cleaner and more readable.

Props enable component reusability and dynamic rendering.

Bootstrap simplifies styling in React projects.
