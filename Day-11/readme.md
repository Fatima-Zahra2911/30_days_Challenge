🚀 Day 11: Props, State, Event Handling & Text Manipulation in React
Today, I deepened my understanding of React fundamentals by exploring Props, State, Hooks, and Event Handling. I also practiced building a simple text manipulation tool that transforms text to uppercase, lowercase, and capitalizes the first letter of sentences, using state, props, and event listeners.

📚 Topics Covered
✅ Understanding Props
Learned how props are used to pass data from parent to child components.

Implemented props to render dynamic content in reusable components.

✅ Understanding State
Explored the useState hook to manage component-level state.

Understood how state updates trigger re-rendering of components.

✅ Event Handling in React
Used event handlers like onClick and onChange to respond to user actions.

Updated state based on user interactions with form elements.

🛠️ Tasks & Hands-On Practice
🔤 Text Manipulation Tool (Mini Project)
Built a text area input where users can:

Convert text to UPPERCASE

Convert text to lowercase

Capitalize the first letter of each sentence

💡 Features Implemented
Real-time state updates using useState

Event handlers for buttons and text input

Passed props from parent to child component to display manipulated text

🧠 Key Learnings
Props are read-only and help in data flow from parent to child.

State holds dynamic data and can be updated with setState (via useState in functional components).

Hooks like useState simplify functional component logic.

Event handling is intuitive and similar to vanilla JavaScript but works through JSX attributes.

Learned how to structure logic for string manipulation and UI rendering in sync.
