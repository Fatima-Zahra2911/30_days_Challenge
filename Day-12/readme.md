🚀 Day 12: Event Handling in React
Today, I focused on handling user interactions in React through event handlers. I learned how to implement events like clicks, form submissions, and how to properly bind event handlers in functional components using hooks.

📚 Topics Covered
✅ Handling User Interactions
Used common React events like:

onClick

onChange

onSubmit

Understood how to respond to user actions within the component lifecycle.

✅ Binding Event Handlers
Explored arrow functions and anonymous functions to bind events inline in JSX.

Learned best practices for writing clean and performant event handling code.

🛠️ Tasks & Practice
🖱️ Implemented Click Events
Built buttons that respond to clicks with visual feedback and state updates.

📝 Form Submissions
Created a form with input fields.

Handled form submission using onSubmit and prevented default behavior using event.preventDefault().

🧪 Real-Time Input Handling
Captured and displayed user input in real time using onChange and useState.

🧠 Key Takeaways
Event handling in React is similar to HTML/JS but uses camelCase syntax (onClick, not onclick).

Arrow functions make it easier to bind event handlers in functional components.

Handling events allows dynamic and interactive user experiences.

event.preventDefault() is essential for preventing unwanted default form behavior.
